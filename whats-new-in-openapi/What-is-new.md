# Version 3.0 of The OpenAPI Specification - The evolution of a success story

OpenAPI is the new name for what was previously referred to as the [Swagger specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md). Swagger has been successfully used to design, describe, generate, validate thousands of APIs in companies all around the world. A sure sign of a successful product is that its users want it to do more.  Judging by the OpenAPI github repository, there are many more features users want to see incorporated into the next version of the specification. Also, experience in creating APIs has identified places where improvements could be made to make it quicker to create, easier to maintain and more expressive to support more common scenarios.

## Moving forward
Earlier this year, the development of the Swagger specification was moved over to the [Open API Initiative](https://openapis.org/), a new group in the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/). As part of this process, a working group called the Techinical Developer Committee(TDC) was formed. The mandate being to respond to all the user feedback and create an updated [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/OpenAPI.next/versions/3.0.md), that would build on the success of its predecessor.  With many hours of effort from core members of the group, much feedback from the wider community and a number of extensive proposals from member organizations, there has been significant progress made on addressing the requests of the user base.

## Herding Cats
One of the early challenges the group faced was attempting to get a handle on exactly what users were asking for.  Github issues are great for capturing the details a specific problem with a product, but when issues are used for feature requests they can become long and detailed discussions that contains all kinds gems of information in a mountain of words.  Issues created by different users often describe similar features, but from different perspectives and there can be significant overlap.  The first job was to process, filter and organize all the feedback into related groups so that the TDC could discuss the issues, create and review proposals to address the feedback.

As promised in the [previous post](https://openapis.org/news/blogs/2016/07/you-can-get-involved-creating-openapi-specification-and-heres-how) that explained the background and organization behind the evolution of the spec.

The issues have been grouped into six omnibus meta-issues:

# Structural improvements
# Request Parameters
# Protocol and Payload
# Documentation
# Security
# Path definitions

Each of these will take at least a blog post to discuss, and we'll tackle them in order. First upâ€¦
